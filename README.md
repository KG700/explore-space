### Tech Stack and Dependencies
This application has a React frontend with Typescript. Redux has been used for state management.

#### Dependencies:
- redux
- react-redux
- redux-thunk
- axios
- antd

### Future Improvements
#### Code Improvements
- To avoid duplicating code across components for specific spaceship types (rockets / dragons), refactor state to store both rockets and dragons in the same object. Will need to customise the key-values that are stored since rocket and dragons contain different types of details. To create list view, filter on rocket/dragon, and to display details view, filter on id. This will make the code slimmer, more DRY and more scalable.
- Replace type 'any' with specific type definitions.
- Add router application so url updates with /rockets or /dragons when selected.
- Update to only call api when page first loads, rather than everytime Rockets or Dragons are selected.

#### Design Improvements
- Make card size for each space ship list item a consistent dimension.
- Add a logo.
- Add a favicon.
- Format first flight dates to dd mmm yyyy format.
- Add pictures to the detail modals.
- Convert css files to modular style.

#### Test Improvements
- Learn how to test applications with redux then test:
- [ ] App: WelcomeMessage displays when page is first loaded
- [ ] App: Rocket cards display when Rockets is selected
- [ ] App: Dragon cards display when Dragons is selected
- [ ] WelcomeMessage: when select in props is SpaceShips.BLANK message displays
- [ ] WelcomeMessage: when select in props is not SpaceShips.BLANK message does not display
- [ ] SpaceShipList: when SpaceShips.BLANK, SpaceShipList renders null
- [ ] SpaceShipList: when SpaceShips.ROCKET, SpaceShipList renders rockets in props
- [ ] SpaceShipList: when SpaceShips.DRAGON, SpaceShipList renders dragons in props
- [ ] RocketDetails: is visible when rocket object isn't empty and isVisible prop is true
- [ ] RocketDetails: is not visible when rocket object is empty
- [ ] RocketDetails: is not visible when isVisible is false
- [ ] DragonDetails: is visible when dragon object isn't empty and isVisible prop is true
- [ ] DragonDetails: is not visible when dragon object is empty
- [ ] DragonDetails: is not visible when isVisible is false
- [ ] Test actions and reducer
